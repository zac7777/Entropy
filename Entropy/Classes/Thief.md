Commandeer
	Using a soldier's weapon against them is a sure-fire way to make sure you're never outgunned, just make sure they haven't got a sidearm
Saboteur
	Opponents' weapons are made fragile and useless by this thief, sadly the salvage is destroyed, but at least you leave with your life
Backstabber
	A keen eye for positioning and an invisible hand makes the last thing they'll ever feel a sharp pain in their back
Blaster

Witch of the Pious

Witch of the World
	Nature is the greatest source for all arcane, whether it be the deafening crack of lightning, or the unstoppable flow of lava from a volcano
Witch of the Bond
	 A protection focused caster, not only for oneself but for allies too, teamwork is the real magic

*Transport Lair:* 6 AP, you summon a personal, circular field of arcane comfort of 10m in diameter at your location, objects can be stored here, rituals prepared and then moved.

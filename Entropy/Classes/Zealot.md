Rage
	Blind anger to all those that would disrespect that which gives you your power
Joy
	A love to it's beauty that must be spread to all those that somehow oppose the kindness
Owe
	It deserves more than you could ever sacrifice for it, time to make others pay the endless debt
Peace
	 All must reach a mindless enlightenment, a conversion by words or the blade

**Pathways:**
Weaponsmith
	Simple metallic weapons become legendary forges when modified, and while you make them you learn their use
Armoursmith
	Metal armour with complex defence systems, while your knowledge on war-tools isn't strong, you sure know how to make a sturdy garb
Whitesmith
	The smaller things matter more sometimes, delicate instruments of ammunition and homelife, but if you want to use them you'll have to find more kit
Experimentalist
	What is the point of inventing if not to create something new! Create unique weapons inspired, and permitted, by the gods above.

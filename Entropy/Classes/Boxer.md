Heated palms
	Thermal energy from the centre of the hand, to freeze, to burn, all will scatter enemies into pieces
Charged fingers
	The static potential at one's fingertips, who could resist the power of thunder in one's palm
Life knuckles
	Control over life and death at a mere touch, draining and donating, only those who deserve their energy should have it

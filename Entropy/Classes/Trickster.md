**Pathways:**
Imitator
	Once an opponent is taken out of the fight, they can be easily replaced with your masterful illusion
Soothing seer
	A serene feeling can hurt as much as it can help, the fever of battle is too much for some soldiers too handle, put them to rest
Petrifier
	Fear is the strongest emotion of all, not only can it cause one to attack their nightmare, but even freeze the strongest warriors
Distracter
	 The core to a successful soldier is focus and dedication, so clearly they're the best targets to uproot

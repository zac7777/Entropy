**Pathways:**
Hidden death
	An invisible, silent, sharp feeling is the last most of your targets will ever feel, try to make sure their allies don't notice you either
Collateraliser
	Standing next to each-other is the last thing your targets want, when your every strike will send them all to death, hand in hand
Hunter
	A survivor and animal handler, tracking foes with the help of a natural companion and ending their tracks too
Giant slayer
	Heavy armour and dense flesh make difficult kills for others, but not this sniper, massive damage with a very specific kind of victim.

**Pathways:**
Quickdraw gunslinger
	The quickest eye and arm they can manage, better hope your enemies fall in one shot, or there's bound to be much more reloading in your future
Maelstrom of magic
	The tools of the arcane weren't exactly designed for such quick application and reuse, but desperate times call for desperate casting
Blade wielder
	This duellist doesn't care for fancy guns nor spells, the tools of the ancient serve fine enough for the disposal of foes
Jack of all
	Variation is said to be the spice of life, and while it may take more energy to constantly swich style, a wide arsenal can wipe any threat from the field

## Progression

Insight bonus when determining turn order: +3

---
#### Level 1:

HP: 2d8 + Insight
AP: 5 + Reasoning

*Zero in:* whenever you land a hit (either with a spell or a weapon), spells you cast this turn have +1 to their minimum and you gain -5 accuracy until end of turn
###### Moves
*Hold breath:* 1 AP, you gain -10 accuracy for your next attack with a medium or long weapon and automatically fail the next spell minimum that targets you, this may only be activated once per turn

*Hunker down:* 2 AP, if you have not moved this turn you may pay 0 AP instead. While "Hunkered Down" you have -10 accuracy and +10 dodge, your moves that affect your allies cost 1 AP less (This cannot reduce their cost to below 1), and if you would receive knockback you may roll 1d10 + Endurance, if this roll is higher than the distance you would be knocked the knockback fails to move you. If you move more than 2m in one turn this effect will end.

*Rally cry:* 4 AP, all allies that can hear you gain +1 AP on their next turn and +2 DT to mental damage until the end of combat

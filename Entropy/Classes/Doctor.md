- *Collect Culture:* whenever you apply bleeding to a creature, heal bleeding on a creature, or find a large sample of disease in some other way ( this can be negotiated with your Game Master ), you gain a "Sample" these may be spent whenever you or another creature within 10m would become Poisoned to become immune to it until the next time you or they would become Poisoned. You can have a maximum of five "Samples".

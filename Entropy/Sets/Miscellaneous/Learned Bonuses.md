#### Old

You have -2 DT to bludgeoning, rot, and mental, but get +2 to your insight outside of combat.

---
#### Resurrected

You only have EP loss doubled when at a quarter of your maximum health, are resistant to Rot damage, but have a constant odour, glazed over black eyes, and will die when you fall to 0 EP.

---
#### Protagonist

Upon falling to 0 HP, you will not immediately die. Instead, you gain three "Death points" then at the beginning of each of your turns you take a d10 roll with the following effects, then may act out a near death experience your character is currently facing, or a part of your past that flashes before your eyes:

| d10 | Effect                  |
| --- | ----------------------- |
| 0   | Instantly die           |
| 1   | Gain two "Death Points" |
| 2   | Gain one "Death Point"  |
| 3   | Gain one "Death Point"  |
| 4   | No effect               |
| 5   | No effect               |
| 6   | Lose one "Death Point"  |
| 7   | Lose one "Death Point"  |
| 8   | Lose two "Death Points" |
| 9   | Return to 1 HP          |
Any creature within Melee range gains the following move:

*Assist:* 2 AP, target creature within melee range loses one "Death Point"

If you would take damage from any source you gain one "Death Point", if that damage is critical you gain two "Death Points".

Upon reaching ten "Death Points" you instantly die, upon falling to zero "Death points" you return to 1d6 HP

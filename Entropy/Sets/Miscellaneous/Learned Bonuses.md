These will show how types of afflictions or lifestyles will effect a creature in Entropy, they're not designed just to help players be more effective in combat, but also to immerse them in unique challenges or special bonuses. Some will have multiple levels to show how these abilities of a character may dynamically progress over a story, so that a Game Master can limit their power, or reward strong role-play, each bonus given by the different levels will all be given together as one buff.

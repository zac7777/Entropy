## Level 1
#### Minor holomimic
*Short, Focus, Primitive, Innate*

##### Actions

*Fake Object:* 2 AP, create a three dimensional projection of an object in your memory with a size smaller than a cube with 1m side-lengths, at any location within 10m. A creature that succeeds the roll with recognise it as a magic creation. The projection has no physical form, weight or interaction with the world, it cannot be moved after it's creation.

Avoidance type: Connection
Roll minimum: 4

---

*Fake Video:* 5 AP, create a two dimensional, animated plane that can stretch over a square with up-to 5m side-lengths, at any location within 10m. It can display any image, message, or fake view that you wish it to, only those familiar with the spell might recognise it, but it's a pretty good illusion when facing it head-on. The projection has no physical form, weight or interaction with the world, it cannot be moved after it's creation.

---

*New Vision:* 7 AP, target creature within 10m has an illusion form in front of their eyes that mimics three dimensional reality, you may have this display any environment, objects, and creatures you want, but the more ridiculous the more likely they will see through it. This cannot generate sound or tactile sense.

Avoidance type: Insight
Roll minimum: 5 + Reasoning ( yours )

---
*A great beginner spell for early casters, harmless, fun, and with room to develop technique, well... harmless until students become creative*

## Level 2
#### Feign Strike
*Contact, Martial, Common*

##### Actions

*False Attack:* 1 AP, you may activate any attack on a currently equipped weapon except it has no effect other than visually ( it doesn't deal damage or apply effects, but will trigger abilities of other creatures based on you activating an attack and will make them think the attack has been activated )

---

*Forced Image:* 3 AP, target creature you can see within 20m activates any attack on a currently equipped weapon except it has no effect other than visually ( it doesn't deal damage or apply effects, but will trigger abilities of other creatures based on them activating an attack and will make them think the attack has been activated )

---

*Younger students see no value in not attacking, they have much to learn about tricking people*

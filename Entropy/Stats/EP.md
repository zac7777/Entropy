Energy Points: These determine how long a creature can fight before falling unconscious. When a move is activated, a player normally loses EP equal to the AP cost however, if an effect alters the AP cost of a move, this won't change how much EP is lost, although some effects change the amount of EP lost, these won't change the AP cost.,

The total EP a player has can be calculated by: 

EP = Level * ( 15 + Endurance ), then any bonuses that player may have

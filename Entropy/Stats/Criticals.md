When a weapon hits, it might by luck be devastating, this chance is determined by the weapon used and the user's connection attribute. If the hit-roll is above 100 minus the critical chance, then the weapon will deal triple the total damage after all other damage calculations have been made ( including after DT and resistances ).

The Critical Chance can be calculated by:

Chance =  5 + Connection * 2, then any bonuses that player or weapon may have

Each class will excel at using certain tools, this both effects their ability to hit or dodge attacks, and also to unlock certain special attacks or effects their items can perform. If a player has no proficiency with a certain weapon, they cannot equip it.

The number of weapon proficiencies is specific to each weapon you use, but armour proficiency is totalled across all protective equipment you have currently attached.

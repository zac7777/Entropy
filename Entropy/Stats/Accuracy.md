Each attack has the potential to miss, and each creature has the potential to dodge. When an attack is made a d100 is rolled if it's value is above the combined totals of dodge and accuracy it will hit.

Whenever an attack is made, it's accuracy can be calculated by:

Accuracy = attack's accuracy - number of weapon proficiencies

Health Points; the measure of a creature's wellness, both physical and mental, it is capped at a certain number, and will decrease as a creature is hurt or exerts themselves. When a creature's health goes below half of their maximum, whenever they pay an [[EP]] cost they lose double the amount of EP after the normal cost is paid, when that creature's health drops to 0 or below, they will die.

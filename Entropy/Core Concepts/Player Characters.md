Players interact with the world of Entropy through their characters, and beneath personalities and histories is the three mechanical pieces of each creature: moves, abilities, and stats. These can be granted from the class, species or creation of a character or they can be earned through a story's many trials.

## Attributes

Upon creation, each player character is given values for 6 attributes, each defining their physical, mental and personal capabilities. They can be rolled, or chosen by a person to match whatever character they wish to create (often, characters don't begin with Attribute values bigger than +4, but you can do what you want if it matches your character).

| Type     | Name       | Determined by | Description                                                                 |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Physical | Power      | 1d10-5        | The maximum physical or magical ability someone can output                  |

| Mental   | Memory     | 1d10-5        | The amount someone can know or learn                                        |

## Classes

A player also chooses one class upon creation, this will majorly define how they fight, and also possibly how they act outside of combat. Each class has a major and minor attribute that is required for functioning as that archetype.

|                     | Ranged, Spread                | Ranged, Precise              | Melee, Precise             | Melee, Spread             |

The classes are also intended to match the four Keywords of it's column and row.

## Species

A player will also have a creature type, they will gain any bonuses, move speed, and melee range from that species. A species will also affect their physical appearance.

[[Human]]
[[Arachnine]]
[[Gefelan]]
[[Dafall]]
[[Ocham]]
[[Lemen]]
[[Reptus]]
[[Incanus]]

## Levels

Levels are a vague guideline for the power-level of characters, creatures, and items. In addition, players get bonuses every certain amount of levels:

##### Every single level
- A player may gain a new level of a class they have unlocked already

##### Every other level
- A player may, instead of upping the level of an already known class, unlock a new class and begin at it's first level, a player can have a maximum of five classes

##### Every fourth level
- A player may, instead of any class alterations, increase one of their Attribute values by one, this cannot increase them beyond +5

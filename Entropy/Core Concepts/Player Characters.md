## Attributes

Upon creation, each player character is given values for 6 attributes, each defining their physical, mental and personal capabilities. They can be rolled, or chosen by a person to match whatever character they wish to create (often, characters don't begin with Attribute values bigger than +4, but you can do what you want if it matches your character).

| Type     | Name       | Determined by | Description                                                                 |

## Classes

A player also chooses one class upon creation, this will majorly define how they fight, and also possibly how they act outside of combat. Each class has a major and minor attribute that is required for functioning as that archetype.

|                     | Ranged, Spread                    | Ranged, Precise              | Melee, Precise             | Melee, Spread            |

The classes are also intended to match the four Keywords of it's column and row.

## Species

A player will also have a creature type, they will gain any bonuses, move speed, and melee range from that species. A species will also affect their physical appearance.

[[Human]]
[[Arachnine]]

## Levels

Levels are a vague guideline for the power-level of characters, creatures, and items. In addition, players get bonuses every certain amount of levels:

##### Every single level
- A player may gain a new level of a class they have unlocked already

##### Every other level
- A player may, instead of upping the level of an already known class, unlock a new class and begin at it's first level, a player can have a maximum of five classes

##### Every fourth level
- A player may, instead of any class alterations, increase one of their Attribute values by one, this cannot increase them beyond +5

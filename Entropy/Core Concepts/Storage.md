Each player can only carry so many items, whether it be in their arms, in their clothes or in accessories, there's a limit to the weight anyone can carry. If a player reaches this limit, they are immobilised until they reduce their item's weight to below their carry weight.

This maximum can be calculated by:

Carry weight = Level * ( 10 + Power ), then any bonuses that player may have

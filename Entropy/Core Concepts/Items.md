Each player and creature can collect many items and keep them in their [[Storage]]. Some have a combat focus, whilst others are designed for exploration. Each can "break" where it becomes unusable and weightless but still stored for repair or reuse. Some can be "improvised", where a player can spend a downtime to craft one item (with a level less than or equal to theirs) breaking the ingredients used.

### Types of items:
- [[Weapons]]
- [[Armours]]
- [[Attachments]]
- [[Spells]]
- [[Ammunition]]
- [[Consumables]]
- [[Miscellaneous]]

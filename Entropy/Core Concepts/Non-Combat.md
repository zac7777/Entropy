## Exploration

A majority of Entropy is spent searching through locations designed by the Game Master, there may be items, characters, and combats to find. These allow for players to tell their story and play the game in sync. I personally recommend simulating the locations of each entity on a miniature environment all players can see, then giving each player a turn to move around and interact with objects, trying to make sure everyone has equal time to engage. Many types of interaction may also have a Challenge associated, such as opening a door requiring a Power roll higher than 6, or convincing a guard to let you pass requiring an Insight roll higher than 4, the difficulties of these rolls can be determined by the Game Master but they allow simulating an unpredictable world we find in our real lives.
## Downtime

After Combat and Walking have taken their toll, lying down and performing leisurely activities can revitalise and re-energise worn-out players. Some classes will give the player something to do during downtime, but if a player chooses to do nothing, as long as the downtime is longer than 4 hours, they will regain all HP and EP.
## Conversation

Speaking and Role-play is the most unique part of Entropy, players and the Game Master take their assigned roles and improvise entire conversations, these can immerse players in a world, move the story along, and even add fun gameplay elements such as deception, argumentation or persuasion. These may also have challenges, such getting a discount with a trader requiring a Connection roll higher that 8, or forgetting the mayor's name if you roll Memory less than 3.

## Fall damage

At a fall of 3 meters or higher, you will begin to take bludgeoning damage that bypasses any DT or vulnerabilities/resistances/immunities. Past 10m, you will begin crippling limbs, rolling a d2 for each limb and crippling them on a 0. Falling happens at a speed of 50m per round, then damage is taken once the ground is reached.

The damage taken from a fall can be calculated by:

Fall damage = ( Height - 3m ) d4 bludgeoning damage

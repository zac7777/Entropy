Combat initiates when a person or group wishes to attack another, then each combatant takes turns in an order determined by highest to lowest Insight + 1d10 (plus any other bonuses), if two creatures get the same value: player characters will go before non-players, players can decide between themselves who goes first, and a game-master can decide the order of equal valued non-players.

In combat, each combatant has several stats that effect how they fight:
- [[HP]]: Determined by Class + Level
- [[EP]]: Determined by Endurance + Level + Class
- [[AP]]: Determined by Class + Level
- [[DT]]: Determined by armour
- [[Resistance and Immunity]]: Determined by armour + Class + Species
- [[Proficiencies]]: Determined by Class
- [[Action List]]: Size determined by Memory, Contents decided by player
- [[Dodge]]: Determined by reasoning + armour + armour proficiency
- [[Accuracy]]: Chance determined by weapon + weapon proficiency
- [[Criticals]]: Chance determined by weapon + connection

## Turns

Once turn order is determined, each individual turn acts the same: a creature makes any number of moves until they reach their AP limit for spending their EP.

Combat initiates when a person or group wishes to attack another, then each combatant takes turns in an order determined by highest to lowest Insight + 1d10 (plus any other bonuses), if two creatures get the same value: player characters will go before non-players, players can decide between themselves who goes first, and a game-master can decide the order of equal valued non-players.

In combat, each combatant has several stats that effect how they fight:
- [[HP]]: Determined by Class + Level
- [[EP]]: Determined by Endurance + Level + Class
- [[AP]]: Determined by Class + Level
- [[DT]]: Determined by armour
- [[Vulnerabilities, Resistances, and Immunities]]: Determined by armour + Class + Species
- [[Proficiencies]]: Determined by Class
- [[Action List]]: Size determined by Memory, Contents decided by player
- [[Dodge]]: Determined by reasoning + armour + armour proficiency
- [[Accuracy]]: Chance determined by weapon + weapon proficiency
- [[Criticals]]: Chance determined by weapon + connection

It's often better for Game Masters to keep these hidden from players, both for immersion, and surprise when certain actions turn out as failures or shocking successes.
## Turns

Once turn order is determined, each individual turn acts the same: a creature makes any number of moves until they reach their AP limit for spending their EP.

## Moves

Turns are composed of moves that have AP costs, there are four different types of moves:

- Attacks: these are often made with weapons, they deal direct damage and sometimes have extra abilities. They also have an accuracy and critical value, and only target one creature within a given range unless specified otherwise. Whether or not an attack hits or crits is determined by a d100 roll and two bounds:

  Lower "hit" bound = Accuracy + Dodge, if the d100 roll is lower than this the attack will not hit
  Upper "crit" bound = 100 - Attack Critical - Creature Critical Modifier, if the d100 is greater than this the attack will land a critical hit

- Challenges: these are often spells or special moves, they sometimes deal damage or have special effects and target only one creature within a given range unless specified otherwise. These have avoidance types and minimums, describing the modifier the target should add to their d10 roll then if they roll below the minimum they will fail the challenge and the move will hit as described.

- Buffs and Nerfs: these apply lasting effects to creatures or objects ranging from "the next use" to "for several turns".

- Utilities: this includes any other kind of move such as walking or equipping a weapon, these often require no rolls or calculations, and are necessary to a rounded action list

When damage is dealt by a move, it will have a type defined in [[Damage Types]], each character may have unique ways they react to each form of damage.

Some Nerfs have defined names and effects in [[Status Effects]], this means that effect is given and interacted with often enough to get a name.
## Awareness

Many types of fighters try to avoid the gaze of their opponents during combat, "Awareness" describes this phenomena in Entropy combat, if a creature has awareness of another they know where they are, otherwise they cannot target them and must target a location in hopes that it will hit the creature anyway. Awareness is gained when a creature can see another or hears them speak, then awareness is lost when they can no longer see them or by certain moves.

## Cover

Fights should take place in environments with obstacles and shape, the amount of cover is dependant on how much of a creature can be hit through it, then that amount effects the accuracy. For example:

- Quarter cover: +25 Accuracy or -2 minimum
- Half cover: +50 Accuracy or -5 minimum
- Full cover: +100 Accuracy or -10 minimum

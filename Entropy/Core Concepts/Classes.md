A player's classes offer moves and bonuses to assist them in and out of combat, they have ten levels each, unlocked when a player chooses to upgrade to the next upon levelling up. The odd levels of a class supply one bonus and three moves for any player in that class, these act as the spine for how that class performs, then the even levels give a mix of bonuses and moves for the four subclasses of a class, each showing diverse expressions of a class's core theme.

Support/Supported: these define classes that often give buffs to their teammates, nerf their enemies, or generally assist in combat outside of doing damage directly opposed to classes that receive buffs, punish enemies for being nerfed, and are the main dealers of carnage among their party.

Variable/Specific: these are classes that have a shallow main theme, allowing for each player to tailor their full fighter into a style they enjoy or find effective offering any function to face any enemy, opposed to classes that do one thing very well and if they're not performing as designed won't be nearly as effective.

Ranged/Melee: the simplest category, classes that use long range to their advantage tend to have more consistent abilities requiring less common kinds of equipment opposed to those that use positioning and their body's proximity as a tool to avoid attacks, and return their own with anything strong enough to use to whack someone.

Spread/Precise: these classes will prefer to swap targets constantly and generally don't get to close out fights on their own quickly or easily, but will make sure everyone is equally weak when their allies take their turn opposed to classes that can focus on larger targets, cleaving down their health before moving onto the next.

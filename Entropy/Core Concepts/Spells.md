In the world of Entropy, the use of spells is no different than the flexing of a muscle when swinging swords: almost anyone can use them, they require a pool of energy to cast, and can be learnt like weapons can be collected. 

When a player casts a spell onto a target in combat, that target rolls a d10 + their avoidance bonus, then if their roll is above the minimum the spell will not hit.

In the world of Entropy, the use of spells is no different than the flexing of a muscle when swinging swords: almost anyone can use them, they require a pool of energy to cast, and can be learnt like weapons can be collected. 

When a player casts a spell onto a target in combat, that target rolls a d10 + their avoidance bonus, then if their roll is above the minimum the spell will not hit.

Spells are often learned from tomes or professionals, however during downtime players may take 10 hours for each level of an innate spell to learn it, but they must be at it's level or higher to do so.

If a spell has a lingering effect, it will often be tagged with "Focus", as it's effect will end when you lose focus on that spell, most casters can only have one spell with "Focus" active at once. Some spells require a "Conduit" to be cast, such as a wand or staff, these direct a caster's energy so that more powerful spells can be evoked. "Ingredients" and even a "Ritual" may be needed for a spell, these must be prepared before casting and then are consumed, a "Ritual" will take some amount of time and cannot be moved.

## Progression

##### Base:
EP bonus: +25
Weapon proficiency bonus: +1

---
#### Level 1:

HP: 4d12 + 2 * Power
AP: 3 + Endurance

*Zero in:* whenever you land a hit (either with a spell or a weapon), spells you cast this turn have +1 to their minimum and you gain -5 accuracy until end of turn
###### Moves
*Hold breath:* 1 AP, you gain -10 accuracy for your next attack with a medium or long weapon and automatically fail the next spell minimum that targets you, this may only be activated once per turn

*Hunker down:* 2 AP, if you have not moved this turn you may pay 0 AP instead. While "Hunkered Down" you have -10 accuracy and +10 dodge, your moves that affect your allies cost 1 AP less (This cannot reduce their cost to below 1), and if you would receive knockback you may roll 1d10 + Endurance, if this roll is higher than the distance you would be knocked the knockback fails to move you. If you move more than 2m in one turn this effect will end.

*Rally cry:* 4 AP, all allies that can hear you gain +1 AP on their next turn and +2 DT to mental damage until the end of combat

- *Harden spirit:* 2 AP, target ally that can hear you gains +2 to it's next avoidance roll when targeted by a spell

Battle mage:
- *Weak resistance:* if a target of a spell you cast rolls 5 lower than the minimum, that spell will deal double damage after all other bonuses are applied
- *Imbue:* 3 AP, choose a move from a spell you know, the next attack with target weapon within 5m will cast that spell when it hits a target, the spell will be casted where the weapon hits, and any creatures that would be affected by the spell will automatically fail the avoidance roll
- *Lay trap:* 1 AP, the next spell you cast will instead be cast as an invisible trap attached to a surface within 20m. When a creature steps within 1m of this trap, the spell will be cast with an additional minimum equal to your Power.

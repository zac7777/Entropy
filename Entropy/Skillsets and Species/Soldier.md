*Hold breath:* 1 AP, you gain -10 accuracy for your next attack with a medium or long weapon and automatically fail the next spell minimum that targets you, this may only be activated once per turn

*Hunker down:* 2 AP, if you have not moved this turn you may pay 0 AP instead, while "Hunkered Down" you have -10 accuracy and +10 dodge, moves that affect your allies cost 1 AP less (This cannot reduce their cost to below 1), and if you would receive knockback you may roll 1d10 + Endurance, if this roll is higher than the distance you would be knocked the knockback fails to move you.

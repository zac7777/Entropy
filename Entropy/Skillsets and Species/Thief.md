**Pathways:**
Commandeer
	Using a soldier's weapon against them is a sure-fire way to make sure you're never outgunned, just make sure they haven't got a sidearm
Saboteur
	Opponents' weapons are made fragile and useless by this thief, sadly the salvage is destroyed, but at least you leave with your life
Backstabber
	A keen eye for positioning and an invisible hand makes the last thing they'll ever feel a sharp pain in their back
Blaster
	A mix of an arsonist, demolitions expert and shotgun-firing-corpse-maker, exploding into a rain of treasure and future flammables## Progression

---
#### Level 1:

HP: 4d12 + 2 * Power
AP: 3 + Endurance

*Zero in:* whenever you land a hit (either with a spell or a weapon), spells you cast this turn have +1 to their minimum and you gain -5 accuracy until end of turn
###### Moves
*Hold breath:* 1 AP, you gain -10 accuracy for your next attack with a medium or long weapon and automatically fail the next spell minimum that targets you, this may only be activated once per turn

*Hunker down:* 2 AP, if you have not moved this turn you may pay 0 AP instead. While "Hunkered Down" you have -10 accuracy and +10 dodge, your moves that affect your allies cost 1 AP less (This cannot reduce their cost to below 1), and if you would receive knockback you may roll 1d10 + Endurance, if this roll is higher than the distance you would be knocked the knockback fails to move you. If you move more than 2m in one turn this effect will end.

*Rally cry:* 4 AP, all allies that can hear you gain +1 AP on their next turn and +2 DT to mental damage until the end of combat

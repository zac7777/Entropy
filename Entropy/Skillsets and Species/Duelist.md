**Pathways:**
Quickdraw gunslinger
	The quickest eye and arm they can manage, better hope your enemies fall in one shot, or there's bound to be much more reloading in your future
Maelstrom of magic
	The tools of the arcane weren't exactly designed for such quick application and reuse, but desperate times call for desperate casting
Blade wielder
	This duelist doesn't care for fancy guns nor spells, the tools of the ancient serve fine enough for the disposal of foes
Jack of all
	Variation is said to be the spice of life, and while it may take more energy to constantly swich style, a wide arsenal can wipe any threat from the field

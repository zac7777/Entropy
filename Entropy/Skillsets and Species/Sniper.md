**Pathways:**
Hidden death
	An invisible, silent, sharp feeling is the last most of your targets will ever feel, try to make sure their allies don't notice you either
Collateraliser
	Standing next to each-other is the last thing your targets want, when your every strike will send them all to death, hand in hand
Hunter
	Tracking each foes trail and making sure they end exactly where you want them to, leaving message-corpses in your wake
Giant slayer
	Heavy armour and dense flesh make difficult kills for others, but not this sniper, massive damage with a very specific kind of victim.

## Progression

##### Base:
EP bonus: +15
Effective range with medium and long weapons: +10m

---
#### Level 1:

HP: 2d8 + 3 * Endurance
AP: 1 + Reasoning

*Pure focus:* being "Aimed" instead ends whenever you use a move other than "fire", "reload", "move", or if you are moved by an effect (this no longer ends when your turn does)
###### Moves
*Take no prisoners:* 2 AP, this turn whenever you reduce an opponent to HP below 1, gain 1 AP

*Iron aim:* 3 AP, (This move puts you into the "Aimed" condition), While "Aimed" you have -5 accuracy and -20 dodge, "fire" moves on weapons you use cost 1 AP less (This cannot reduce their cost to below 1). This move may only be activated while you have a medium or long weapon that does not have an attached sight.

*Identify threat:* 4 AP, target creature you can see takes an additional damage equal to your Reasoning every time it would be damaged, this effect ends when you lose sight of that creature or if you re-use this move on a different creature. This may only be activated once per turn.

#### Level 2:

HP: Previous HP + Endurance
AP: 3 + Reasoning

###### Pathway bonuses

Hidden death: 
- *Strength in squads:* gain +2 accuracy for each allied creature within 20m
- *Light instruction:* in any downtime you may teach one of your allies how to use a single weapon, this will give them +2 proficiency in that specific weapon (this does not apply to categories like "Pistols" only one weapon like "Manufactured handgun")
- *Harden spirit:* 2 AP, target ally that can hear you gains +2 to it's next avoidance roll when targeted by a spell

Collateraliser:
- *Weak resistance:* if a target of a spell you cast rolls 5 lower than the minimum, that spell will deal double damage after all other bonuses are applied
- *Imbue:* 3 AP, choose a move from a spell you know, the next attack with target weapon within 5m will cast that spell when it hits a target, the spell will be casted where the weapon hits, and any creatures that would be affected by the spell will automatically fail the avoidance roll
- *Lay trap:* 1 AP, the next spell you cast will instead be cast as an invisible trap attached to a surface within 20m. When a creature steps within 1m of this trap, the spell will be cast with an additional minimum equal to your Power.

Hunter:
- *Passionate tinkering:* in any downtime you may add or remove attachments from firearms, you now also gain the knowledge to craft any craftable attachments that are used for guns
- *Tactical reload:* 1 AP, you may activate the "reload" move on any number of equipped weapons for free, this may only be activated once per combat
- *Dead eye:* 5 AP, you may activate the "fire" move a total amount of times equal to your Power distributed on any number of equipped weapons (as long as your weapons don't run out of cartridges). As long as they all target the same creature, you gain -10 accuracy for all of these attacks

Giant slayer:
- *Quicker action:* when rolling for turn order you may use Endurance as a bonus instead of Insight
- *Unseen and deadly:* any turns you take during combat while enemies are unaware of your presence gain an additional AP equal to your Endurance
- *Sneak attack:* 2 AP, Melee Range, 1d10 + Power suffocation damage, the target rolls 1d10 + their Endurance, if it's less than 5, they are instantly brought to 0 EP. This attack may only be used if the target is unaware of your presence

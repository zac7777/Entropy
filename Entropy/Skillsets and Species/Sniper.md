**Pathways:**
Hidden death
	An invisible, silent, sharp feeling is the last most of your targets will ever feel, try to make sure their allies don't notice you either
Collateraliser
	Standing next to each-other is the last thing your targets want, when your every strike will send them all to death, hand in hand
Hunter
	Tracking each foes trail and making sure they end exactly where you want them to, leaving message-corpses in your wake
Giant slayer
	Heavy armour and dense flesh make difficult kills for others, but not this sniper, massive damage with a very specific kind of victim.

*Pure focus:* being "Aimed" instead ends whenever you use a move other than "fire", "reload", "move", or if you are moved by an effect (this no longer ends when your turn does)
###### Moves
*Take no prisoners:* 2 AP, this turn whenever you reduce an opponent's HP to below 1, gain 1 AP

*Iron aim:* 3 AP, (This move puts you into the "Aimed" condition), While "Aimed" you have -5 accuracy and -20 dodge, "fire" moves on weapons you use cost 1 AP less (This cannot reduce their cost to below 1). This move may only be activated while you have a medium or long weapon that does not have an attached sight.

*Identify threat:* 4 AP, target creature you can see takes an additional damage equal to your Reasoning every time it would be damaged, this effect ends when you lose sight of that creature or if you re-use this move on a different creature. This may only be activated once per turn.

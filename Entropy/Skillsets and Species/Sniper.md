**Pathways:**
Hidden death
	An invisible, silent, sharp feeling is the last most of your targets will ever feel, try to make sure their allies don't notice you either
Collateraliser
	Standing next to each-other is the last thing your targets want, when your every strike will send them all to death, hand in hand
Hunter
	Tracking each foes trail and making sure they end exactly where you want them to, leaving message-corpses in your wake
Giant slayer
	Heavy armour and dense flesh make difficult kills for others, but not this sniper, massive damage with a very specific kind of victim.

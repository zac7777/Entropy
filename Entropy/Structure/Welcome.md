## Hello!

I'm so grateful that you are reading this document, it travelled across worlds to find you. Me and my team have turned our vast knowledge of the many worlds that surround yours into a game that you and your friends can play. While we do have ulterior motives, I will not hide them, this file is enchanted with a 'magic' that allows me to see and learn from each and every campaign, character, and concept you design. Please take the resources we have given to recreate things from your world, or invent entire planes of your own, but most importantly: play Entropy, the decisions you make, both in combat and out, teach us more about yourselves than a worldwide assimilation ever could, so don't make us resort to that.

## [[Player Characters]]

This file will teach you how you can design characters to battle in Entropy. Each character is unique, and we could never hope to simulate personalities, that is where you come in. Your role-play tells stories efficiently and from the heart, no planning or calculations can account for it. What we do offer however, is a system of classes, species and items designed after our worlds that will let you recreate it on one table.

## [[Non-player Creatures]]

A massive bestiary of monsters and allies you will fight with. We scoured the planes to find the most dangerous and unique organisms to challenge and excite you. Though, designing the arenas you'll see them in is your job, and while you're at it, how about making some creatures of your own?

## [[Items]]

What is a world without possessions, tools of war, creativity, and life. Collect them so that you may survive our world, and use them to forge a world you wish to find. Learn their mastery, find how in combination they become even more powerful, connect them with yourself: become the hero with the sword, or the villain with the knife. If they cannot capture your needs, design the next generation of implements, and run into the breach of new ideas.

## [[Setting]]

But where will your adventurers find themselves? That is for you to decide, only you know what stage the story must be performed upon. Here we have contributed worlds of our own, simplified for your benefit, perfectly conducive to special and impactful tales. A legend does not start without a challenge to face, and a people to tell it.

## [[Combat]]

I see you, I know what you want; red mist in your head, blood on your knuckles, fire on the arena's ring. Develop a fighting style unheard of in our world, expressed through dice and numbers. You'll see it in your head, a champion facing indeterminate odds, crimson flame in his heart besting the unknown. Don't be one of those pansies who solves conflict with words, slaughter all those who oppose you, invent ways to strike them with your own unknown.

## [[Non-Combat]]

Don't listen to that last guy, the most expressive part of life is talking, problem solving, and searching. We become animals when we fight, we lose our identity not create it. The calm of storytelling is where we see interactions and learn what you've created.

## [[Maths Rules]]

Sadly, once our world was re-designed in game form, compromises where made to maintain the many complexities of life. These are some global rules that describe what certain key-words mean, and how mathematical interactions take place, but they're subject to change by your taste.

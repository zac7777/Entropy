Entropy follows several rules for the many calculations in it's ruleset:

- Halving or Division always rounds down after it is performed

- Equations follow the rules of "PEMDAS", any calculations involving parenthesis are performed before multiplication/division, which is performed before addition/subtraction

- The letter "d" denotes the usage of a die:

| Name   | Shape                         | Possible outcomes                              |
| ------ | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| d2     | Flat disc/ Coin               | 0, 1                                           |
| d4     | Tetrahdron/ Pyramid           | 1, 2, 3, 4                                     |
| d6     | Cube                          | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6                               |
| d8     | Octahedron                    | 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8                         |
| d10    | Pentagonal trapezohedron      | 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9                   |
| d12    | Dodecahedron                  | From 1 to 12                                   |
| d10x10 | Pentagonal trapezohedron      | From 00 to 90 in multiples of 10               |
| d20    | Icosahedron                   | From 1 to 20                                   |
| d100   | Two Pentagonal trapezohedrons | From 1 to 100 (If you roll 0+00 that is a 100) |

  A number before the "d" describes how many rolls you must make and add for a calculation, there may also be a value before the d such as "Power" this means you rolls you make and add is equal to that value (if this value is negative, you make that many rolls then subtract the total instead).

- "Advantage" when rolling means to roll twice then take the more positive outcome as the result

- "Disadvantage" is the opposite, roll twice and take the more negative outcome as the result 

- Unless specified otherwise, if the outcome of a damage roll is negative, the value should be taken as zero instead. This is the same for rolls that would increase a target's health.

- If multiple Buffs/Nerfs would come in conflict you may either:

	- Have player effects always take priority over non-player sources, then if two player effects come in to conflict they may decide between them, and the game master may decide the priority of non-player effects
	- Let your Game Master decide all priorities based on what is fair, or what would make sense within the world

- If an AP or EP cost would be reduced to less than one, it is reduced to one instead

- Some moves will put you into states such as "Aimed" or "Spinning", these can only be applied once at a time, and will apply to every move referencing them even if the source of that state was a separate move

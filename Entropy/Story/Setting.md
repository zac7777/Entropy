Entropy is based in an omniverse of dying energy, dense pockets of energy are considered planes, where the world the energy creates slowly dies as the energy dissipates.

**Planes:**
- [[Ehlen]]

Some large collections of energy happen to be complex enough to form consciousness, these are powerful and mobile enough to act as extra-planar beings to lower species, or gods.

- [[Gods]]

A plane where all beings were born with exactly equal energy potential, this lead oppression to be born out of collaboration, several clans forming in the early world which lead to entirely isolated cities of like-minded, cult-like people. A central, secret cabal exists that keeps things this way, whenever someone figures out there are other cities, they are "Blanked", put on an eternal document to be hunted for the rest of their life.

# Clans

## The Sighted (Colourless, Power)

The secret group driven by order and peace, they underestimate the compassion of other clans, believing the best solution to be keeping them entirely separate, at any cost.

Method of power: Secrecy, manipulation and propaganda

Pros: 
- Those within the group are treated well
- Wars between the clans are prevented
- Clans are free to decide their own fates
Cons:
- Constantly interfering with not only other clan's people's lives, but within The Sighted people are distrusting and manipulative
- Despite having far greater resources (due to stealing every good idea the clans ever had) they never lend a hand for fear of too-quick-to-handle development
- They spend most of their time Blanking newly enlightened people from other clans, lots of murder

## Ospresis (Green, Connection)

A clan driven by luck and birth-right, believing that all things that happen do for a reason and expecting power to come to those who deserve it, trusting that those with it are meant to have it.

Method of power: Privilege, settling, hope

Pros: 
- Those within the clan are happy even in poverty
- The population booms due to a hope that any child could be a success
- People born into riches get to stay that way
Cons:
- People suffering or dying are often left that way
- Technological, sociological, and economical development tends to be incredibly slow, they feel no need to change the correct world
- People are often treated differently based on their Connection stat, being seen as a signifier of their prospects


## Furcoasa (Red, Endurance)

A clan driven by interest and creativity, incredibly elitist - with only those the best in their field able to have any control over their actions (the completers).

Method of power: determination, enthusiasm, passion

Pros:
- Well developed with high technological prowess
- Those with the strongest will live great lives and are remembered
- Those without passion still have positions as workers for the completers
Cons:
- Non-completers live in squalor, starving, homeless and seen as replaceable by their society
- Completers have to constantly exert and fight for their positions, leaving them exhausted and burnt out
- Human experimentation is very common


## Jyasla (Black, Insight)

A clan with full trust in their immediate opinions, they see the surface as the only information needed to make decisions, allowing others to think for them.

Method of power: charisma, superficiality, intuition

Pros:
- Life is generally easy, most people living in blissful ignorance
- Little bureaucracy or conflict, decisions and actions are made swiftly
- Those who work hard generally get rewarded, though many are predisposed to failure by ugliness or other "defects"
Cons:
- About half the decisions made are objectively harmful, greedy politicians and dysfunctional infrastructure are built
- Undesirables are left completely destitute, no-one will trust them and they have no power without optics
- People are constantly conned and tricked, working against their own best interests to feed the most powerfully attractive

## Imeron (Blue, Reasoning)

A clan that recognises their little power as individuals, instead they form groups that make decisions together, and despise the divergent.

Method of power: grouping, tribalism, collectivism

Pros:
- People are free to choose a purpose that they dedicate their lives to, even if their wants change
- Large projects and infrastructure are completed within lifetimes, the Imeron cities bustle with progress and knowledge
- Policies are designed to appeal to as many people as possible, appeasing the majority of the population
Cons:
- Anyone with divergent and individual views are labelled heretics, shunned, and even killed
- People aren't allow to change their faction after they pick, if an ideology works for them once, it must always work
- Projects that would only appeal to minorities will never be completed, it's not worth it to not appease the lowest common denominator

## Woldok (White, Memory)

A clan that follows it's roots, doing it's best to never change with the time and stick to what worked before.

Method of power: tradition, age, stability

Pros:
- People have strong bonds due to their family traditions, large, altruistic communities are formed
- The living products of this society tend to be well off, strong survival skills and insanely large memories
- The land they inhabit is essentially the same as at the beginning of Ehlen, flora and fauna thrive, the magic of the area too
Cons:
- People die young, successful birth-rate low, absolutely no scientific advancements made
- A strong set of laws keep any divergence locked up or executed, people truly believe change will end the world
- There is lots of infighting between factions of the Woldok, when people disagree on the past it's important only one version is remembered

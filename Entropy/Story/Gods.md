Immortal beings that tend to interfere in mortal matters, they appreciate worship and dedication much like the tiny beings they toy with. Each may be beseeched at any time, but they require a high d100 roll to successfully receive their favour, though some classes automatically receive the favour of a god of their choice.

### Olo, Father to Justice
*(He/Them)*
The last being creatures see before they die, born before the very first plane, decided it was their role to punish the evil and reward the good once they reach the world beyond Entropy. Whenever creatures he decides are worthy of judgment would be destroyed he Olo instead sacrifices a part of his energy to maintain their form in his realm - [[Ã†x]] -  where he will decide a poetic fate for their lives.

*Favour:* Once per turn, you may convince your Game Master that you are acting morally correct in a situation, if they decide you indeed are, you gain complete immunity to any chosen effect that is about to hit you.

### Tentrus, King to the intelligent
*(He/Him)*
Scouring his plane, he collected the means and knowledge to become an omniscient being. Him and his cult of the true mind form a combined energy enough to grant their collective effort omnipotence. Their goals, not omnibenevolent, instead they only wish to collect as much knowledge as they can by any means, mostly recruiting and brainwashing those with it.

*Favour:* During combat, you may tell your game-master how you would defeat a combatant using their special weakness, if they decide it is worthy your next attack that exploits that weakness will be an automatic critical hit.

### Nighlush, Queen by boldness
*(She/It)*
In what was once her home plane, "Nighlush" was the name of a dark spirit from a fable that convinced a young girl to overthrow the Queen of her kingdom. This god earned her name when she exterminated every other living being in her Plane in bloodthirsty conquest, leaving her as the sole creature able to access the entirety of her plane's energy. The plane became her realm, and she became a god, finding those worthy of her strength and granting it.

*Favour:* Once per combat, you may take a speak action for free to say something intimidating to target intelligent creature than can hear you, if your game-master decides it is worthy that creature will immediately surrender it's weapons.

### Elarus, Lord of Creativity
*(They/Them)*
A small hand in the birth of every new plane, they describe events never heard of before, they make new designs. A more powerful force than Entropy, chaotic, beautiful, and kind to those sharing their vision.

*Favour:* Once per combat, you may re-describe an attack in a cool way, if your game-master decides it is worthy, that attack will gain a -30 accuracy bonus, and be executed how you describe.

### Palraq, courage's soul
(Any)
Died many times, never stayed that way. Pushed through the suffocation and freeze between planes just to meet his love once more. Her very spirit is found within anyone that fights and will not back down until victory is attained. It's often disputed whether Palraq was ever a conscious person, or always an incarnation of the mindless determination found from prey to apex.

*Favour:* Once per combat, you may tell your Game Master that a certain action is narratively crucial to your character's story, if they decide you are correct, you may activate that action without any cost or restriction (this applies to range, requirements, AP cost, ETC)

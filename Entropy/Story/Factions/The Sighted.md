*(Colourless, Power)*

The secret group driven by order and peace, they underestimate the compassion of other clans, believing the best solution to be keeping them entirely separate, at any cost.

Method of power: Secrecy, manipulation and propaganda

Pros: 
- Those within the group are treated well
- Wars between the clans are prevented
- Clans are free to decide their own fates
Cons:
- Constantly interfering with not only other clan's people's lives, but within The Sighted people are distrusting and manipulative
- Despite having far greater resources (due to stealing every good idea the clans ever had) they never lend a hand for fear of too-quick-to-handle development
- They spend most of their time Blanking newly enlightened people from other clans, lots of murder

*(White, Memory)*

A clan that follows it's roots, doing it's best to never change with the time and stick to what worked before.

Method of power: tradition, age, stability

Pros:
- People have strong bonds due to their family traditions, large, altruistic communities are formed
- The living products of this society tend to be well off, strong survival skills and insanely large memories
- The land they inhabit is essentially the same as at the beginning of Ehlen, flora and fauna thrive, the magic of the area too
Cons:
- People die young, successful birth-rate low, absolutely no scientific advancements made
- A strong set of laws keep any divergence locked up or executed, people truly believe change will end the world
- There is lots of infighting between factions of the Woldok, when people disagree on the past it's important only one version is remembered

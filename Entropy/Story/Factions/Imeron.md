*(Blue, Reasoning)*

A clan that recognises their little power as individuals, instead they form groups that make decisions together, and despise the divergent.

Method of power: grouping, tribalism, collectivism

Pros:
- People are free to choose a purpose that they dedicate their lives to, even if their wants change
- Large projects and infrastructure are completed within lifetimes, the Imeron cities bustle with progress and knowledge
- Policies are designed to appeal to as many people as possible, appeasing the majority of the population
Cons:
- Anyone with divergent and individual views are labelled heretics, shunned, and even killed
- People aren't allow to change their faction after they pick, if an ideology works for them once, it must always work
- Projects that would only appeal to minorities will never be completed, it's not worth it to not appease the lowest common denominator

*(Red, Endurance)*

A clan driven by interest and creativity, incredibly elitist - with only those the best in their field able to have any control over their actions (the completers).

Method of power: determination, enthusiasm, passion

Pros:
- Well developed with high technological prowess
- Those with the strongest will live great lives and are remembered
- Those without passion still have positions as workers for the completers
Cons:
- Non-completers live in squalor, starving, homeless and seen as replaceable by their society
- Completers have to constantly exert and fight for their positions, leaving them exhausted and burnt out
- Human experimentation is very common

*(Black, Insight)*

A clan with full trust in their immediate opinions, they see the surface as the only information needed to make decisions, allowing others to think for them.

Method of power: charisma, superficiality, intuition

Pros:
- Life is generally easy, most people living in blissful ignorance
- Little bureaucracy or conflict, decisions and actions are made swiftly
- Those who work hard generally get rewarded, though many are predisposed to failure by ugliness or other "defects"
Cons:
- About half the decisions made are objectively harmful, greedy politicians and dysfunctional infrastructure are built
- Undesirables are left completely destitute, no-one will trust them and they have no power without optics
- People are constantly conned and tricked, working against their own best interests to feed the most powerfully attractive

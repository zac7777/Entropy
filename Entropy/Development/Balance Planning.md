### How balance should work:

- A player of level x should be able to take out 10 creatures of level x before running out of EP or HP, with an average amount of level x equipment
- A creature of level x should be double as powerful as a creature of level x - 1 (same applies to players until level 10)
- So a party of 4 level 10 adventurers could feasibly take out 400 level 10 creatures or one level 18.6 creature, and a strong amount of collaboration should get them up to a level 20 kill

### A baseline level 1 player:

~ 25 EP
~ 5 AP
~ 15 HP

Last for 5 turns total

Outputs 10 damage a turn
### A baseline level 1 creature:

~20 EP
~3 AP
~5 HP

Last for 7 turns total

Output 0.5 damage a turn

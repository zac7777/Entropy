Here, me and Cameron can talk easier

### Task list (We going Kanban with this shit):
- Finish first 2 levels of all classes
	- Beastmaster
	- Smith
	- Survivalist
- Probs need to re-do Knight, Soldier, and Boxer as they were done very early days
- Write some test combats
- Maybe a short-ish one-shot too, to test out character creation (Characters go in [[Test Characters]])
- Just make a vast array of early-game items, showing off what our system is built to handle
	- This has got to include non-damage focused combat utilities like food and drugs (potions if you're a groomer)
- More non-player creatures
	- Maybe some kind of pet system with them
- Fix my grammar

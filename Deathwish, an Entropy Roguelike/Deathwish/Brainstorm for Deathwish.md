- Begin with a party of ~4
	- Each one is an adventurer searching for the Deathwish, the greatest spell ever invented, that grants the caster anything they could want in exchange for their life
	- Begin at home base, with a permanent character for permanent upgrades, and maybe more home base characters as the party progresses
	- Travel through worlds until the Deathwish is reached at the end of the seventh
		- Forest with stealthy enemies, mess with lighting and awareness. Theme with plants and wild animals, then horror story style monsters for bosses.
			- Level 1-5
		- Ocean with mobility enemies, swapping from land to sea and outranging players. Theme with fish and pirates, then oilpunk nightmares for bosses
			- Level 6-10
		- Arcane-lands with status effects, nerfing players until they struggle to fight. Theme with outcast magicians in wild ethereal lands, then elementals and failed experiments for bosses.
			- Level 11-15
		- Industrial with tactical enemies, using cover and team tactics to swarm players. Theme with post war destruction and soldiers, then great war machines for bosses
			- Level 16-20
		- Cybercity with tanky enemies, immovable threats that constantly advance. Theme cyberpunk but devoid of humanity, with tangled bio-amalgams as bosses.
			- Level 21-25
		- Extraplanar with unique enemies, flipping the rules and never expected. Theme as eldritch horror beyond comprehension, non-Euclidian and non-sensical bosses
			- Level 26-30
		- Finale, the Pacifist, refuses to kill the party or let them access the Deathwish. Believes no-one should have to die ever, must be convinced through conversation.
			- The party's knowledge of the story, and moral reasoning should let them convince the Pacifist of a more nuanced truth
	- The players are expected to die many times, upgrading after each death, and finding a new dungeon each time
	- As they play again and again, they will learn more about the world of the Deathwish, find other characters also searching for it, and face moral quandaries of legacy and sacrifice

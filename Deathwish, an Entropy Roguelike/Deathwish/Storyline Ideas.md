## Themes

Death isn't that significant

Doing stuff for dead people is dumb

There can be good times to kill people

## Halfbrain ideas

Cult that worships the Pacifist, party gets a foreshadow of the final boss and it's ethics

A group of lumberjacks who only do it because their dead parents did, show how much the memory of someone can affect them, show changing generations as the party runs into them again and again large spans of time between each Deathwish run.

A vigilante figure that has been long dead, but criminals still live in fear, and civilians still live in hope

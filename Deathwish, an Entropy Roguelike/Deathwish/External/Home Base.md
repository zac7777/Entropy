A tavern, the classic start to an adventure, and it will be the start to many adventures. Has several merchants and characters to design permanent upgrades for the players in exchange for Desire, but at the first run only one character is unlocked:

The Bartender; Edward Varmunkle, the Reptus Barkeep with a massive array of knowledge on every substance that can make a man more determined, mostly booze.

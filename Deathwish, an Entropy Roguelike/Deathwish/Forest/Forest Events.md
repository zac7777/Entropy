## The Tourists

A well armed parent and child, akin to Joel and Ellie or Lee and Clem. The parent has a mortal wound and pleadingly whispers to the party to kill them, so that their kid doesn't feel guilty for not curing them. The party can:

- Walk away, allowing the parent to slowly die. This will leave a randomly selected party member cursed with "Karma"
- Cure the parent, requiring at least 15 HP and a Reasoning challenge of 7, the child will be very grateful and dedicate their life to healing, giving the Party a "Survivors' Cap"
- Kill the parent, making 2 utility items spill from their bag, and the child vow revenge, running off into the forest with their parent's weapons in tow

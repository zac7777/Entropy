## The Lumberers

A gang of Lumberjacks, constantly unsatisfied with their careers, yet continue Jacking because it's what their late parents did. They will be currently making a trail through the woods, with a hut rolling across logs as their home. The players may take a downtime, and try to find any Lumberer with an interest in combat as a companion.

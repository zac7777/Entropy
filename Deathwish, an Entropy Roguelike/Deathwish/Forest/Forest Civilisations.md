## The Lumberers

A gang of Lumberjacks, constantly unsatisfied with their careers, yet continue Jacking because it's what their late parents did. They will be currently making a trail through the woods, with a hut rolling across logs as their home. The players may take a downtime, and try to find any Lumberer with an interest in combat as a companion.

## Woodland Critters

Many small species of forest-dwelling animals live inside the large corpse of an ancient forest giant, they have families, homes and culture and yet if the giant was allowed to regenerate all would be lost. There is a vulnerable spell circle in the centre of town preventing it's return, keeping the giant in a nightmarish limbo. the players may take a downtime, and recruit the giant as an ally if they save it by destroying the town.
